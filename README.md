# chalk

A [Prolog-ish][Prolog] interpreter written in Rust, intended perhaps for use in
the compiler, but also for experimentation.

## Origin of the name

`chalk` is named after [Chalkidiki], the island where [Aristotle] was
born. Since Prolog is a logic programming language, this seemed a
suitable reference.
